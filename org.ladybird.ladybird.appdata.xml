        <p>
            Ladybird is a brand-new browser and web engine. Driven by a web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with good performance, stability and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.
        </p>
        <p>
             Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes Ladybird unique:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Truly independent - No code from other browsers. We're building a new engine, based on web standards.</li>
            <li>Singular focus - We are focused on one thing: the web browser.</li>
            <li>No monetization - No "default search deals", crypto tokens, or other forms of user monetization, ever.</li>
        </ul>
